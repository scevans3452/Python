# FIGHTERJET

## roadmap for v2:
- give each **bullet** a `damage value`
  - this will allow `upgrades` to increase bullet damage
- give each **enemy** a `health value`
- change **ammo** powerup to something like rapid fire
- remove ammo number and give player infinite ammo  

- give `exp` on killing enemy
  - `exp` can be spent in upgrades tab
